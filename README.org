#+TITLE: Org-roam-similarity

Welcome to my fork of ~org-similarity~ by Bruno Arine. As you can assume from the name, this fork is about integrating ~org-similarity~ and ~org-roam~ more. ~org-similarity~ is a very cool package for helping Emacs discover files which are related to a certain file. In its current implementation it has an input of a file (which has to be the current buffer) and an output of a list of links in text pointing to files which are similar to the current file.

This isn't a problem in itself, however, if you want to integrate it more with org-roam you need to be able to do more than that. I plan to make the output of the low-level function (the one that exists in the original) to be a list of org-roam nodes as then, from the list of nodes you can write functions which do various useful actions with that list. I also want to make the input more flexible by allowing the user to select any node from their system instead of only the current buffer. This is all going to be on the basis of Bruno's original code (who I would like to thank for his amazing work if he ever sees this) but with more elisp under the hood to manipulate the python script's output in a way that org-roam can use it better.

Development on this fork started at December 19th 2022 and I will try to have most of the functionality ready in the coming months. Once its fleshed out, I plan to document it better and then release it on MELPA for public usage. If you would like to collaborate in this project, feel free to email me at vidianosgiannitsis@gmail.com or here. I will try to be very active here, especially during Christmas holidays as this idea interests me a lot.

Below is the original README which contains important instructions for installing and using this package. Since I am going to change a lot of it, it will need to be updated, but for now, it will have to do.

* org-similarity

=org-similarity= is a package to help Emacs [[https://orgmode.org][org-mode]] users discover similar or related files. Under the hood, it uses Python and [[https://github.com/scikit-learn/scikit-learn][scikit-learn]] for text feature extraction, and [[https://github.com/nltk/nltk][nltk]]  for text pre-processing. More specifically, this package provides a function to recursively scan a given directory for =org= files, clean their content by stripping the front matter and some undesired characters, tokenize them, replace each token with its respective linguistic stem, generate a TF-IDF sparse matrix, and calculate the cosine similarity between these documents and the buffer you are currently working on.

** Dependencies
 - Emacs 24 or above
 - Python 3
 - [[https://github.com/scikit-learn/scikit-learn][scikit-learn]] 
 - [[https://github.com/nltk/nltk][nltk]] 

 To ensure you have the latest packages, run:
 #+begin_src
$ pip install -U scikit-learn nltk
 #+end_src

** Installation

*** Via straight.el
#+begin_src elisp
(straight-use-package
 '(org-similarity :type git :host github :repo "brunoarine/org-similarity"))
#+end_src

*** Doom Emacs

  #+begin_src elisp
(package! org-similarity
  :recipe (:host github :repo "brunoarine/org-similarity"))
  #+end_src
  
*** Via cloning

You can also clone the repository somewhere in your load-path. If you would like to assist with development, this is the way to go.

To do that:

1. Create a directory where you’d like to clone the repository, e.g. =mkdir ~/projects=.
2. cd ~/projects
3. git clone https://github.com/brunoarine/org-similarity.git

You now have the repository cloned in =~/projects/org-similarity/=. Now paste the following sexps in your init-file (e.g. =~/.emacs.d/init.el=):

#+begin_src elisp
;; If you cloned the repository
(add-to-list 'load-path "~/projects/org-similarity/") ;Modify with your own path
(require 'org-similarity)
#+end_src

You can also copy =org-similarity/= somewhere where load-path can access it, but you’d have to update the file manually.

** Configuration

There are a few variables that can be set to customize how =org-similarity= operates and generates the list of similar documents:

#+begin_src elisp
;; directory to scan for possibly similar documents.
;; org-roam users might want to change it to org-roam-directory
(setq org-similarity-directory org-directory)
;; the language passed to nltk's Snowball stemmer
(setq org-similarity-language "english")
;; how many similar entries to list at the end of the buffer
(setq org-similarity-number-of-documents 10)
;; whether to prepend the list entries with their cosine similarity score
(setq org-similarity-show-scores nil)
#+end_src

** Usage

Use =M-x org-similarity-insert-list RET= to insert a list of =org-mode= links to similar files at the end of your current buffer.
